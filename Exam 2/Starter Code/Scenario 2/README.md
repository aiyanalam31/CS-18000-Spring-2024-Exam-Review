# Assignment Instructions: Student Records Management System

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a simple Student Records Management System program using Java that incorporates concepts related to primitive types, strings, selection, repetition, methods, classes, arrays, file I/O, and exception handling.

## Requirements:

1. Primitive Types & Strings:

- Utilize string data types to handle inputs such as student names.

2. Selection:

- Implement conditional statements (e.g., if-else) to handle different user choices or menu options effectively.

3. Repetition:

- Use loops (e.g., while, do-while, for) to allow the user to repeat certain actions, such as adding multiple books or navigating through the menu.

4. Methods and Classes:

- Define appropriate methods to encapsulate different functionalities like adding students, updating student information, deleting students, displaying student records, calculating average GPA, saving records to a file, and loading records from a file.
- Utilize classes to represent the student entity and the student records management system.

5. Arrays:

- Store the book objects in an array for easy access and management.

6. File I/O and Exception Handling
- Implement file I/O operations to save student records to a file and load them from a file.
- Handle exceptions such as FileNotFoundException or IOException when dealing with file operations.

## Functionality:

The Student Records Management System program should provide the following functionalities:

- Add a Student:
    
    - Add the student to the records.

- Update Student Information:
    
    - Allow the user to select a student and update the student's GPA.

- Delete a Student:

    - Allow the user to select a student to delete from the records.

- Display All Students:

    - Display the details of all the students currently present in the records.

- Calculate Average GPA:

    - Calculate and display the average GPA of all students.

- Save Records to File:

    - Save the student records to a file for future reference.

- Load Records from File:

    - Load student records from a file at the start of the program, if available.
    
## Implementation Guidelines:

- Use proper naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
- Implement error handling where necessary to handle invalid inputs or edge cases.
- Ensure clear and concise user prompts and output messages.
- Organize your code into meaningful functions and classes to improve readability and maintainability.

## Submission Guidelines:

- Submit the Java source code file (.java) containing your implementation.
- Include comments in your code to explain complex logic, algorithmic steps, or any important details.

## Additional Notes:

- You may choose to enhance the functionality or user interface of the program beyond the basic requirements outlined above if you wish.
- Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly in various scenarios.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
