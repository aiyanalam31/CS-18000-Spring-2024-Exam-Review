# Assignment Instructions: Library Management System

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a simple Library Management System program using Java that incorporates concepts related to primitive types, strings, selection, repetition, methods, classes, and arrays.

## Requirements:

1. Primitive Types & Strings:

- Utilize string data types to handle inputs such as book titles, author names, etc.

2. Selection:

- Implement conditional statements (e.g., if-else, switch-case) to handle different user choices or menu options.

3. Repetition:

- Use loops (e.g., while, do-while, for) to allow the user to repeat certain actions, such as adding multiple books or navigating through the menu.

4. Methods and Classes:

- Define appropriate methods to encapsulate different functionalities like adding books, searching books, displaying the inventory, and removing books.
Utilize classes to represent the book entity and the library inventory.

5. Arrays:

- Store the book objects in an array for easy access and management.

## Functionality:

The Library Management System program should provide the following functionalities:

- Add a Book:

    - Prompt the user to enter the title, author name, and year of publication for the book.
    - Add the book to the library inventory.

- Display all Books:

    - Display the details of all the books currently present in the library inventory.

- Search for a Book:

    - Prompt the user to enter the title of the book they want to search for.
    - Display the details of the book if found; otherwise, show a message indicating that the book is not found.

- Remove a Book:

    - Prompt the user to enter the title of the book they want to remove.
    - Remove the book from the library inventory if found; otherwise, show a message indicating that the book is not found.

- Exit:

    - Provide an option to exit the program.

## Implementation Guidelines:

- Use proper naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
- Implement error handling where necessary to handle invalid inputs or edge cases.
- Ensure clear and concise user prompts and output messages.
- Organize your code into meaningful functions and classes to improve readability and maintainability.

## Submission Guidelines:

- Submit the Java source code file (.java) containing your implementation.
- Include comments in your code to explain complex logic, algorithmic steps, or any important details.

## Additional Notes:

- You may choose to enhance the functionality or user interface of the program beyond the basic requirements outlined above if you wish.
- Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly in various scenarios.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
