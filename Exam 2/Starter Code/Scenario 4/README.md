# Assignment: Banking System with Concurrency Handling

## Objective:
Design and implement a simple banking system that supports basic operations like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and viewing transaction history. Additionally, ensure concurrency handling to support multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.

## Requirements:

1. Implement a BankAccount class that represents a bank account with functionalities like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.
2. Ensure thread safety in the BankAccount class to handle concurrent access by multiple users.
3. Create a User class that simulates banking operations by interacting with BankAccount objects.
4. Design a menu-driven interface for users to perform operations on their accounts.
5. Use separate threads to execute user operations concurrently.
6. Handle exceptions like insufficient funds during withdrawals gracefully.

## Instructions:

1. Understanding Requirements:

    - Read and understand the requirements thoroughly.
    - Focus on the key functionalities and the need for concurrency handling.

2. Design:

    - Design the BankAccount class with appropriate methods for deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.
    - Implement a BankingOperations interface to define these methods.
    - Create a User class to interact with BankAccount objects.

3. Concurrency:

    - Learn about concurrency and its importance for this banking system.
    - Ensure that your implementation of the BankAccount class is thread-safe to handle concurrent access by multiple users.

4. Thread Management:

    - Use separate threads to execute user operations concurrently.
    - Each user operation (e.g., deposit, withdrawal) should run in its own thread.

5. Error Handling:

    - Handle exceptions like insufficient funds during withdrawals.
    - Ensure that your code gracefully handles such exceptions to maintain system integrity.

6. Testing:

    - Thoroughly test your implementation to ensure correctness and concurrency safety.
    - Simulate various user interactions and concurrency scenarios to validate your code.

7. Code Documentation:

    - Write clear and concise comments to explain the logic and functionality of your code.
    - Document important aspects such as concurrency handling strategies and error handling mechanisms.

8. Encourage Best Practices:

    - Follow best practices in coding, such as proper naming conventions, modular design, and code reuse.
    - Aim for clean, readable, and maintainable code.

9. Resources:

    - Refer to relevant learning resources on Java concurrency and examples of banking system implementations.
    - Seek additional help or clarification if needed.

10. Creativity:

    - Feel free to explore additional features or improvements beyond the basic requirements if you feel confident to do so.
    - Use your creativity to enhance the functionality or user experience of the banking system.

## Submission:

Submit your Java code along with a brief documentation explaining your design choices, implementation details, and any challenges faced during the development process.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
